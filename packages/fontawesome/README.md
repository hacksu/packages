## FontAwesome

This is a copy of FontAwesome Pro for use by HacKSU and Kent Hack Enough.

This package is an exact replica of `@fortawesome/fontawesome-pro` that FontAwesome instructs you to install.


The FontAwesome Pro License Key is stored in a Github Actions Secret at [github.com/hacksu/packages](https://github.com/hacksu/packages)
that uses an action to download the package and republish it as this, `@hacksu/fontawesome`. You can manually trigger the action to run
to pull newer versions of FontAwesome, assuming `cseitz` keeps paying for it each year.
